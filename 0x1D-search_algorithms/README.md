# 0x1D. C - Search Algorithms
#### What I should learn:
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All program functions are compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
- Code passes `Betty` style checks
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library.
- Prototypes of functions are included guarded in header file

File | Description
-----|------------
0-linear.c | A function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the linear search algorithm
1-binary.c | A function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
3-O | The space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n
4-O | The time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n
5-O | The space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n
6-O | The space complexity of this function / algorithm
